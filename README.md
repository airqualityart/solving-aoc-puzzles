# Introduction

[_Advent of Code_ &reg;](https://adventofcode.com/) is a website that offers
programming puzzles. This repository contains my solutions to these puzzles.

I (_Air Quality And Related Topics_) am the author and copyright holder of
these solutions. Unless otherwise specified on a case-by-case basis, these
solutions are released under the terms of the 3-Clause BSD licence (see the
LICENSE file for more detail).

However, I am not the author or copyright holder of the puzzles themselves, nor
I am the author or copyright holder of any _Advent of Code_ asset. As explained
by [the _Advent of Code_ website](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about):

Notes:

* This repository does not contain the puzzles' input data. It does, however,
  contain mock input data that I created myself to test my solutions on small
  examples.
* _Advent of Code_ puzzles can be solved in a competitive fashion. I prefer to
  solve them at my own pace though, way after the competition is over.
* I believe that the puzzles are most easily solved with a general-purpose
  high-level programming language such as Python. However, I choose to use
  other languages in order to practise with these languages.

# The 2022 puzzles

I am currently working on the solutions to the 2022 puzzles. I solve them using
C.

Note(s) on the implementation:

* To keep the solutions as short as reasonably possible, I try to keep
  defensive programming to a minimum. For example, the solutions rely on the
  assumption that the input data provided by _Advent of Code_ are well formed.
