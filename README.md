# Introduction

[_Advent of Code_ &reg;](https://adventofcode.com/) is a website that offers
programming puzzles. This repository contains my solutions to these puzzles.

I (_Air Quality And Related Topics_) am the author and copyright holder of
these solutions. Unless otherwise specified on a case-by-case basis, these
solutions are released under the terms of the 3-Clause BSD licence (see the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/airqualityart/solving-aoc-puzzles/blob/main/LICENSE)
file for more detail).

However, I am not the author or copyright holder of the puzzles themselves, nor
I am the author or copyright holder of any _Advent of Code_ asset. As explained
by [the _Advent of Code_ website](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about):

This repository does not contain the puzzles' input data. It does, however,
contain mock input data that I created myself to test my solutions on small
examples.

I am currently working on the [2022
puzzles](https://github.com/airqualityart/solving-aoc-puzzles/tree/main/year-2022).
