I had not used C in a long time, so I decided to use this language to solve the
2022 puzzles.

Notes:

* My solutions read the puzzles' inputs from stdin. The script
  [run-solution.bash](https://github.com/airqualityart/solving-aoc-puzzles/blob/main/year-2022/run-solution.bash)
  takes care of compiling the code and running the corresponding binary while
  feeding it the proper input.

* To keep the solutions as short as reasonably possible, I try to keep
  defensive programming to a minimum. For example, the solutions rely on the
  assumption that the input data files provided by _Advent of Code_ are well
  formed.
